## ✨ Features

Mars is a markdown making machine. You can call it mmm🍫. It turns markdown to anything you want to display.

Different from traditional office software, it only provide one input. If you want to change the thing you display, the only way to do is changing input text. It totally follow the MVC(Model-View-Controller) architecture. MVC is a great software architecture pattern. It shouldn't be used only for programming. Wish everyone can have their own MVC workflow to help their job.
